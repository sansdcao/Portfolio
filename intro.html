    <h1>LJ Williams</h1>
    <p>I am a programmer of both the backend and front end, designing this very site myself! I also enjoy coding in my free time.</p>
    <p>I also enjoy greatly learning how to code new things, and enjoy tackling problems with nothing but the internet to guide me!</p>

    <h2>Birthplace</h2>
    <p>I was born in Salt Lake city, but grew up in rawlins around plenty of tech, been using a computer since I was 2.</p>

    <h2>Goals for the future</h2>
    <p>I hope to continue the greatness of the code, pass on beyond just a small thing!</p>
